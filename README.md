A permissive FOSS license allowing derivatives and creativity.  
[Jump to download](#links)

POCL is a license for FOSS (Free and Open-Source Code) allowing you to protect your source code or software from being sold without significant change, while still allowing for derivatives and creativity.

## How to use
When you create a piece of software or code, you already have copyright protection. If you would like to license your code under POCL, simply include a file called `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, `license.txt`, etc. to your code containing the license:

## Where to get the license
The license is available in several formats, including plaintext, Markdown, HTML, etc. in this repo. Simply copy or download the text and put it in your license file.

Make sure to change the text in \<angle brackets\> such as your name and the year.

- [Markdown (.md)](todo)
- [Standalone HTML (.html)](todo)

## Can I modify this license?

### The text:
No, this license is supposed to be the same across all pieces of software it is used in. The only modification allowed is that of the text in angle brackets (`<>`), or on the HTML version, `&gt;` and `&lt;`. All other angle brackets on the HTML version are for text formatting.

### The HTML/Markdown/etc.:
Yes, you can change things such as the styles (CSS), markdown (e.g. changing `#` to `##`) as long as it doesn't obscure the license text or make its meaning different.

### Important note
If you do want to change the license text, you may create your own derivative license based on POCL. You may not make a derivative license without changing its text significantly. Also, make sure you change its name (e.g. "(your name)'s Open Code License") to avoid confusion with the official POCL.

## Why make my software free/open-source?
Most software's code is closed to the public, meaning most of the applications you use daily are collecting and selling your data to companies, governments, and scammers. By making your source code free and open-source, you can show your users that their personal information is safe.

It can also allow for users to modify your code, either for their own preferences or to help you (the author) improve your software and fix bugs.
